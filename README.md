A Small and Functional Snake Game

As i believe its perfect to play (alone or with a Friend)

## Functions

- Fully Working Settings Window
- Two Player Mode
- Scoreboard
- exchangeable Colors (40+)

---

## Buttons

- ESC = Exit to Main Menu 
- Alt + F4 = Exit Game instantly
- Space = Stop Round and Start New one
- Closing the Window = Exit Game

--- 

## Additions

- in this Project i used pygame to code the Base Game
- To make the Settings Window i used Tkinter
- as addition i wrote a litte rgb-color to Hex-Color code translator to make use of one color and not to write it 2 times for tkinter and for pygame
